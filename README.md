# 1- (2p) In your local repository from homework 2, create a blank virtual environment and name it dsci560H4

# 2- (2p) Activate the environment and install ONLY the dependencies you need to execute the random
number generator script of Homework 2.

# 3- (1p) Take a screenshot of your terminal with the activated environment after running the script for the number generator.

# 4-(15p) Extract the dependencies of your virtual environment
# a.(5p) Compare the packages that you manually installed versus the dependency list you extracted.
    manully installed will get what package we want exactly.
    the dependency list we extracted is a .txt file, and it include a lot of names of packages which we not need in our visual environment.
    
# b.(3p) If you created your virtual environment with venv, add the environment folder to a “.gitignore” file so it is not uploaded to GitHub. The “.gitignore” file is a hidden file with all the file extensions to avoid uploading them online. You don’t need to include an answer about this point in the readme, but points will be deducted for not completing this step. See https://git-
 scm.com/docs/gitignore for additional documentation. If you used Anaconda to create your environment, create a gitignore file for filtering XML files.
 
# c.(7p) Upload your extracted dependencies to GitHub following the naming conventions taught in class.

# 5-(20p Update/reuse the Jupyter notebook for Homework 2 and make sure it is executable in Binder (10p). The notebook has to be executable, run end-to-end and include visualizations of the initial (2p), intermediate (4p) and final results (4p) used in Homework 2. An example of a visualization can be a distribution of the numbers generated randomly.

# 6-(10p) In your readme file include the instructions to:

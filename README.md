# 1- (2p) In your local repository from homework 2, create a blank virtual environment and name it dsci560H4

# 2- (2p) Activate the environment and install ONLY the dependencies you need to execute the random
number generator script of Homework 2.

# 3- (1p) Take a screenshot of your terminal with the activated environment after running the script for the number generator.

# 4-(15p) Extract the dependencies of your virtual environment
# a.(5p) Compare the packages that you manually installed versus the dependency list you extracted.
    manully installed will get what package we want exactly.
    the dependency list we extracted is a .txt file, and it include a lot of names of packages which we not need in our visual environment.
 
# c.(7p) Upload your extracted dependencies to GitHub following the naming conventions taught in class.

# 5-(20p Update/reuse the Jupyter notebook for Homework 2 and make sure it is executable in Binder (10p). The notebook has to be executable, run end-to-end and include visualizations of the initial (2p), intermediate (4p) and final results (4p) used in Homework 2. An example of a visualization can be a distribution of the numbers generated randomly.

# 6-(10p) In your readme file include the instructions to:
steps:
1. download zip file of the project from github
2. Enter the file directory from the terminal
3. run: pip install virtualenv (install tool for create visual environment)
4. run: virtualenv dsci560H4 （create visual environment）
5. run: source dsci560H4/bin/activate  （activate visual environment）
6. run: python3 create_dataset.py
7. run: python3 function_dataset.py
8. run: python3 visualization.py
9. run: deactivate (close the visual environment)

1. run the jupyter notebook in binder, execute it.
